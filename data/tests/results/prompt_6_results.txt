DOCUMENT 3:

The document provided does not contain specific information about people involved in human rights violations during the Military dictatorship of Chile. It is a correspondence from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs dated December 3rd, 1976, discussing a project resolution concerning human rights in Chile sponsored by Cuba, Netherlands, and other countries that were approved by the Third Commission of the United Nations General Assembly. Without more specific details on individuals and their actions, no further information can be extracted to aid in finding missing bodies from the period of the Chilean dictatorship. More detailed documents, such as detailed military records, eyewitness accounts, or explicit government reports, would likely be necessary to provide the information needed for such a task.
